### Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing

- Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
- Put text documents associated with the project in the doc directory.
- Put raw data and metadata in the data directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a results directory.
- Put source for the projectâ€™s scripts and programs in the src directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the bin directory.
- Name all files to reflect their content or function.
